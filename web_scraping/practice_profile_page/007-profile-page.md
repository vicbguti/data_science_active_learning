### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Use paragraphs, headings, and images to build a basic profile

### Example

Practically every website on the planet allows users to create a profile. Profiles like those on Facebook aggregate an enormous amount of personal information: age, gender, eye color, height, weight, and the total number of hairs on your body (56,783,238 for me!).


In this exercise, you will use your brand new HTML knowledge to create your own profile that reflects the best things about you!

> Workshop doesn't currently support image upload. If you want to experiment with other images, try an image hosting service like [imgur](https://imgur.com/).


### Exercise

1. Create and open a file named `profile.html`
2. Add the necessary HTML structure: `doctype`, `html`, `head`, `body`, etc.
3. Choose a title for your profile
4. Use a combination of images, headings, and paragraphs to represent yourself. For example:
- Profile Image
- Heading (your name)
- Paragraph (about you!)
- Heading (My Secrets)
- **Several paragraphs divulging all of your deepest, darkest secrets** - We won't read these (out loud)
5. Submit whenever you're satisfied with your profile, no rush. And most importantly, **have fun**!

To preview your work, open `index.html` and add this code to create a link to your profile:

```html
<p><a href="profile.html">Profile</a></p>
```

> You'll learn more about links later.
